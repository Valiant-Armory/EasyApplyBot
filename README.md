## Getting Started
# Setting up EASYAPPLYBOT on Windows with VSCode

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Python 3.10 project in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) on Windows and installing the required dependencies for the EASYAPPLYBOT GitHub project using the PowerShell terminal.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 installed on your system
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode) installed
- Git installed

## Steps

1. Open VSCode and create a new folder for your project.

2. Open the integrated terminal in VSCode by selecting `Terminal` > `New Terminal` from the menu.

3. In the terminal, make sure you are in the project folder directory. You can use the `cd` command to navigate to the desired folder. For example:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Projects\EASYAPPLYBOT
   ```

4. Create a new Python virtual environment by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   This will create a new virtual environment named `venv` in your project folder.

5. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:
   ```powershell
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   You should see `(venv)` appended to your terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

6. Clone the EASYAPPLYBOT repository from GitHub using the following command:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/Valiant-Armory/EasyApplyBot
   ```

7. Navigate to the cloned repository folder:
   ```powershell
   cd EASYAPPLYBOT
   ```

8. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file by running the following command:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This will install all the necessary packages for the EASYAPPLYBOT project.

9. Once the installation is complete, you can run the EASYAPPLYBOT script using the following command:
   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```

That's it! You have now successfully set up a Python 3.10 project in VSCode on Windows and installed the required dependencies for the EASYAPPLYBOT GitHub project using the PowerShell terminal.

If you encounter any issues during the setup process, please refer to the project's documentation or seek further assistance from the project maintainers.

Conclusion
You have successfully set up a Python 3.10 project in Visual Studio Code on Windows and installed the dependencies required for the EasyApplyBot project using the PowerShell terminal. You can now proceed with using and customizing the EasyApplyBot as per your requirements.
